#CN_Grid
A C and C++ library that implements grids.

A "grid" is a non-standard data structure that essentially acts as a 2D Vector (In the C++ implementation, that is what it almost literally is). I made this because I got tired of having to write my own implementations of a grid as a "vector&lt; vector&lt;type&gt; &gt;" in C++ in almost every project I worked in... And also since I saw other people implementing it rather poorly (Hey, mine probably isn't the absolute best implementation either). Since it got annoying enough, I decided to just write a library to settle it once and for all.
